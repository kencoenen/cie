I'm convinced that companies possess data which is rarely used. Therefore, it's only a cost to most companies. However, when properly analyzed and enriched with other data, it can become an indispensable tool to make strategic decisions and add business value.

Being able to retrieve data from different platforms is essential in the context of giving your customers an omnichannel experience. Customers expect new products and services to interact with other platforms. These days, they won't settle for less anymore... and API's can make this dream a reality.

# Wait a minute... What are API's?

Imagine your data safely stuffed away in a vault. You should look at API's as the key to this vault. They make the data consumable for other domains of your business, and maybe even for other companies and partners. Once your data is consumable, the gap to do something with it becomes smaller.

# World Wide Spider Web

API's are real. They're already here. If you look at Google's API Explorer, there are tons of services you can use to integrate with. And other companies like Facebook or Twitter are doing the same. All these services from different companies integrate with each other. More and more, you can compare the World Wide Web with a spider's web, where everything is connected.

# Collaborative economy

When launching a new product or service, it's important to think from the beginning how other companies could interact with it. When you do this right, this can later mean more value and visibility for your product without your company investing in it. For example, 60% of Twitter's feeds originated from other platforms. Another example are marketplaces like the App Store or Google Play, where people can find products which interact with your product or service.

You have to think about required data to launch a new product or service. You might be lucky to be owner of all the data you need, but when you don't, think about teaming up with a partner. When you are going to talk about your idea, make sure you already have an idea of the business value it could add for his/her company.

As stated in the beginning of this article, isolated data can be meaningless, but when aggregated and enriched, we can create truly innovative services. You could say that having an API strategy as a company drives innovation forward.

# Digital transformation

Although you can play around with API's very isolated in one domain of your business, releasing them must not, under any circumstances, be rushed. There are several things to consider first.

First, when considering API's, we need to think about the technologies we'll be using. Both the development and operations aspect is important here. This is where the digital transformation for companies really begins.

The cloud has many advantages, among them the ease of scaling and no need to maintain your own hardware. Many companies find themselves in a hybrid situation these days, where for some parts of their business applications are deployed on premise and other parts are deployed to the cloud. A company's cloud strategy and its API strategy are inextricably entwined.

By rethinking the cooperation between development and operations, you can achieve faster value for your business. And that's what IT is all about: delivering value to the business.

# All aboard the API train!

I want to share the following quote with you, which I came accross on the internet the other day.

> Companies without an API strategy are like computers without internet.

Even if your computer has the fastest processor and neatest looks, nobody would want to use it if it couldn't connect to the internet. The same applies for companies who are not connected. You don't want to live alone on an island where no customer can reach you. A picture of the scenic town Henningsvaer in Norway is very appropriate in this context...

Bottom line... be connected!

Fortunately, you can start experimenting with API's without too much effort and without the risk of affecting your core business. Start small with only one part of your business.

Think of what data you have in your possession and what you could do with it. Be a part of the value chain and monetize your data!
